/***

The fonts directory contains all the information corresponding to the fonts being used in the application.
It includes the definition of all the font font families and font styles that impact the application on the base level.

Note: The location and configuration of this directory may vary from project to project implementation.
For example, if some project requires the fonts to be a part of the theme, i.e.  to be configurable, then this structure will shift inside the theme directory.
